# Research Code Only
Some progress on poking around the Awair internal api for fun.

The `awair_python` project works on the public developer API. This is not that. 

The script is based on REing the Android app and various domain endpoints. The EA-Games Korea Graphql server is out-of-scope. lol.

WIP. Feel free to build off this research. If someone has firmware dumps from the Awair Element (v2) please ping me

See the code and comments for info
